        <p>
          This site was written for the final assignment of the excellent
          <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>
          <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development/home/welcome">
          Introduction to Meteor.js Development</a> course.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general idea is to present a list of websites recommended by users
          and allow them to comment and vote on them. Users can also search the
          sites and get recommendations based on their comments and votes.
        </p>

        <h3>The Code</h3>
        <p>
          The code is on
          <a href="https://github.com/smathx/meteor" class="navbar-link">GitHub</a>.
          It has a lot of rough edges - there is very little error
          checking, recommendations are probably only good for a small number
          of sites, and I'm still not sure about how code should be divided
          between the client and server. It is what it is!
        </p>

        <h3>Test Data</h3>
        <p>
          There are 41 sites already present, 76 users, and a couple of hundred
          comments. All the users have the same password '123456'.
